   <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Packed with tender meat, aromatic spices, sweet apricots and honey, 
    this Moroccan lamb tagine recipe is inspired by the classic flavours 
    of North African cooking. Served with toasted couscous and a nutty 
    coriander sprinkle, it makes a delicious family meal. This is traditionally 
    cooked in a special tagine dish, but a large casserole will work just as well.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lamb stock cube, crumbled</li>
            <li>75g dried apricots, halved</li>
            <li>1 tbsp clear honey</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>400g lamb neck fillet, trimmed and cut into 3cm pieces</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 red pepper, chopped into 1cm pieces</li>
            <li>400g tin chickpeas</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to gas 4, 180°C, fan 160°C. Put the stock cube, apricots, honey and ground spices in a jug and cover with 300ml boiling water. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a high heat. Add half the lamb pieces and brown on all sides for 4-5 mins, then transfer to a large casserole dish (or tagine). Repeat with the remaining lamb.</li>
        <li>Keeping the pan on the heat, add the onion and cook for 8 mins until softened. Add the pepper and continue to fry for 2 mins. Transfer to the casserole dish with the lamb.</li>
        <li>Pour the stock mixture and the whole tin of chickpeas (including the liquid) into the casserole. Put on the heat, stir and then cover the dish and bring to the boil. Transfer to the oven and cook for 50 mins.</li>
        <li>Near the end of the cooking time, put a dry frying pan on a medium heat. Add the flaked almonds and toast for 2 mins until lightly golden, shaking the pan regularly. Tip into a small bowl and mix together with the crushed garlic and chopped coriander, set aside.</li>
        <li>Put the pan back on the heat and add the raw couscous. Toast for 2 mins, stirring the grains until lightly browned. Meanwhile, mix the chicken stock cube with 300ml boiling water.</li>
        <li>Remove the couscous from the heat and pour over the hot stock. Stir and cover, then leave for 5 mins. Fluff up the grains with a fork and stir through the smoked paprika.</li>
        <li>Serve the tagine with the couscous and sprinkle over the almonds, garlic and coriander mix.</li>
    </ol>
