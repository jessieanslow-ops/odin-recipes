   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Inspired by Japanese cooking, these sweet and tangy teriyaki 
    noodles are a simple and satisfying midweek meal. Bursting with fiery 
    flavours, crunchy veg, nutty sesame seeds and griddled chicken, this easy 
    dairy-free dinner is ready in under 30 minutes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   
    <ul>
        <li>650g pack chicken breast portions, sliced into thin strips</li>
        <li>3½ tbsp teriyaki sauce</li>
        <li>250g pack dried medium egg noodles</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil, plus extra for drizzling (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp reduced-salt soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 head of broccoli, broken into small florets</li>
        <li>85g mangetout, halved diagonally</li>
        <li>1 large red chilli, finely sliced</li>
        <li>3 spring onions, finely sliced</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over a medium-high heat and fry the onion and carrots for 10 mins or until very soft and lightly golden. Add the garlic, ginger and curry powder, fry for 1 min, then stir in the four until dissolved. Gradually stir in the stock, then simmer over a medium-low heat for 10 mins or until thickened, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the rice to pack instructions. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove the sauce from the heat and blitz with a stick blender until very smooth. Season, then simmer over a medium heat for another 5-8 mins to thicken more. Preheat the grill to high.</li>
        <li>Cook the fish fingers to pack instructions until crispy and cooked through. Boil the green beans for 4 mins or until tender; drain well.</li>
        <li>Fluff up the rice with a fork and divide between 4 shallow bowls. Add the fish fingers and spoon over the curry sauce. Scatter with the coriander to serve.</li>
    </ol>
