    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Fish fingers get a new lease of life with a Japanese twist - a mild and
        creamy Japanese-style curry sauce, fluffy white rice and fresh green
        beans bring fragrance and flavour to the dinner table. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, grated</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>3cm piece (about 20g) ginger, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp mild curry powder</li>
        <li>3 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>1 chicken stock cube, made up to 500ml</li>
        <li>300g long-grain rice</li>
        <li>10 fish fingers</li>
        <li>220g green beans, halved</li>
        <li>10g fresh coriander, leaves picked</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over a medium-high heat and fry the onion and carrots for 10 mins or until very soft and lightly golden. Add the garlic, ginger and curry powder, fry for 1 min, then stir in the flour until dissolved. Gradually stir in the stock, then simmer over a medium-low heat for 10 mins or until thickened, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the rice to pack instructions. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove the sauce from the heat and blitz with a stick blender until very smooth. Season, then simmer over a medium heat for another 5-8 mins to thicken more. Preheat the grill to high.</li>
        <li>Cook the fish fingers to pack instructions until crispy and cooked through. Boil the green beans for 4 mins or until tender; drain well.</li>
        <li>Fluff up the rice with a fork and divide between 4 shallow bowls. Add the fish fingers and spoon over the curry sauce. Scatter with the coriander to serve.</li>
    </ol>
