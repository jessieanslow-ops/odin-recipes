# odin-recipes

This project is a basic recipe website built as part of The Odin Project Foundations course.

The website consists of a main index page that links to several individual recipe pages. It is intentionally simple and focuses on practicing core HTML concepts rather than visual design.

## Project Goals

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated the ability to:

- Create a basic HTML website structure
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Create links between pages using relative paths
- Structure content with headings, paragraphs, and lists
- Organise files and folders in a clear project structure
- Use Git and GitHub for version control

## Notes

This project is focused on building HTML fundamentals. Styling will be added later when CSS is introduced.
